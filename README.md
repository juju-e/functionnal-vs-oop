# functionnal-vs-oop
An instance in which I differentiate functional programming and Object oriented programming
#### What is OOP:
Object Oriented programming(OOP)is programming paradigm that uses classes and objects, object's uses are describded in classes which are somekind of containers or templates used to describe the behaviour of the object. Python has been one of the OOP languages since it's creation...
#### What is Functionnal programming:
Functional programming, or FP, is a programming paradigm that relies on functions instead of objects or statements to make programs. Python is not a programming language intended for FP unlike some languages like haskell or Elm but it contains some key features found in functionnal programming like lambda calculus, map and filters.

#### Why should you use OOP:
- Objects can also be reused within an across applications,
- It makes software easier to maintain,
- Code reusability.
#### Why should you use FP:
- Pure functions are easier to reason about,
- Debugging is easier,
- Programs are more bulletproof,
- Programs are written at a higher level, and are therefore easier to comprehend,

Please visit the code for more info it is commented and the comments show the differences between the 2 paradigms.
