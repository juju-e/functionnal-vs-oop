# functionnal-vs-oop
An instance in which I differentiate functional programming and Object oriented programming
#### What is OOP:
An object oriented program is based on classes and there exists a collection of interacting objects, as opposed to the conventional model, in which a program consists of functions and routines. In OOP, each object can receive messages, process data, and send messages to other objects. 
#### What is Functionnal programming:
Functional programming, or FP, is a programming paradigm that relies on functions instead of objects or statements to make programs. Python is not a programming language intended for FP unlike some languages like haskell or Elm but it contains some key features found in functionnal programming like lambda calculus, map and filters.

#### Why should you use OOP:
- It provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes in which implementation 
- details are hidden.
- Objects can also be reused within an across applications. ...
- It makes software easier to maintain. ...
- Reuse also enables faster development.
#### Why should you use FP:
- Pure functions are easier to reason about
- Testing is easier, and pure functions lend themselves well to techniques like property-based testing
- Debugging is easier
- Programs are more bulletproof
- Programs are written at a higher level, and are therefore easier to comprehend

Please visit the code for more info it is commented and the comments show the differences between the 2 paradigms.
